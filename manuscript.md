### Abstract
**Ash emission in <sup></sup>explosive silicic eruptions can have widespread impacts for human health, agriculture, infrastructure, and aviation. Estimates of the total grainsize distribution (TGSD) generated during explosive magma fragmentation underpins eruption models and ash dispersal forecasts. Conventionally, the TGSD constrained via erupted deposits is assumed to match the TGSD produced at explosive fragmentation. Here we present observations from within the vent of a recent rhyolitic eruption (Cordón Caulle, Chile, 2011–2012), demonstrating that fine and ultra-fine ash particles are captured and sintered to fracture surfaces, and thus sequestered in the shallow subsurface, rather than emitted. We establish a conceptual model—uniquely contextualised through a combination of syn-eruptive observations and detailed post-eruption field investigation—in which turbophoresis (particle migration towards zones of lower turbulence) and rapid sintering create an inverse relationship between particle size and the probability of its subsurface capture. Such size-dependent capture efficiency preferentially removes submicron-diameter ash from the erupted componentry, decoupling the erupted size distribution from magmatic source conditions and potentially playing an important role in modulating eruption dynamics.**

Understanding the controls on silicic volcanic eruption style is a grand
challenge in geoscience<sup>1</sup>. Silicic eruptions---and rhyolitic eruptions
in particular---remain enigmatic, in part because very few such
eruptions have been observed. While key observations of the preserved
and variably eroded deposits of past eruptions have proved invaluable in
our understanding of silicic eruptive dynamics^2--5^, recent eruptions
at Chaitén (2008--2009) and Cordón Caulle (2011--2012), both in Chile,
were witnessed directly and have allowed us to observe how rhyolitic
eruptive processes proceed in real-time^6--9^. The blurred transition
between explosive eruptions and subsequent lava effusion, together with
evidence for shallow in-conduit reassembly and welding of pyroclastic
debris, has led to a model in which effusive lava may be produced
top-down from the products of the explosive phase^2,10^. This is
consistent with the presence of sintering textures in all phases of a
silicic eruption: obsidian pyroclasts and welded pumice in fall
deposits^11--13^, tuffisites in volcanic bombs^10,14,15^, and partially
sintered surfaces in the effusing lava itself^2^. This model raises
questions about the poorly constrained structure of the uppermost
conduit feeding the eruption as well as the relationship between emitted
products and the at-depth source parameters.

The total grainsize distribution (TGSD) of erupted volcanic ash
particles controls their subsequent transport and sedimentation^16,17^,
related respiratory health hazards^18^, their preservation as
geochronologically important tephra layers^19^, their geochemical
reactivity^20^, and their use as indicators of the magnitudes of past
volcanic events^21,22^. A key question remains: how does the TGSD of
particles generated via subsurface fragmentation relate to the size
distribution of particles emitted into the atmosphere and fed into
plumes? Dispersal models assume an inverse relationship between particle
size and mobility, with the smallest ash fraction found most distal to
the vent due to its low settling velocity^23^, and larger clasts being
constrained closer to the vent^24^. However, recent field observations
demonstrate the existence of 0.1--100 µm variably sintered ash particles
coating the fractures that provided pathways for ash emission^2^. The
demonstrable capture of fine ash within the vent itself shows that a
re-evaluation of microscale ash emission processes is necessary.

**Results: In-vent observations from the 2011--2012 Cordón Caulle
eruption**

The 2011--2013 Cordón Caulle eruption was initially characterised by a
Plinian phase during which the ash plume reached \>15 km height (**Fig.
1a**); this soon gave way to a ten-month-long hybrid explosive--effusive
phase characterised by intermittent ash plumes, with synchronous lava
effusion and explosive activity from a common vent^25^. Syn-eruption
videography in January 2012 revealed near-continuous ash venting with
sporadic Vulcanian blasts occurring from two highly-fractured \~50--80
m-diameter lava piles within a single coalesced, horseshoe-shaped tephra
cone^9^. Ash plumes, 2--5 km high, emanated from clusters of sub-vents
ranging from near-point sources to arcuate, 10--30 m-long fractures
(**Fig. 1b--d**). Sub-vents exhibited variable transitions between
quiescence, steam venting, dilute ash venting, and incandescent bomb
emission over timescales of 1--10 seconds, with apparent correlations
between separate sub-vent activity indicating their subsurface
connectivity. Bombs exited the vent at \~100 m.s^-1^, and largely fell
within the tephra cone or on raised ground to the north and north east.

Field investigation in January 2014, shortly following cessation of
eruptive activity, allowed the correlation of the syn-eruptive
observations of ash venting processes directly with specific structures
within the vent (**Figs 1e--g**). In particular, here we describe
veneered surfaces of *in-situ­* fracture planes (**Fig. 1f,g**), which
are the surface expression of ash venting pathways active during the
prolonged hybrid phase of the eruption. By January 2014, the vent areas
consisted of fractured obsidian lava with ubiquitous red fracture
surfaces (**Fig. 1f,g**). These---as with tuffisite structures found in
the distal flowfield^15^---correspond to sub-vent structures observed in
2012 (**Fig. 1b--d**)^9^. They range from smooth, curviplanar surfaces
extending over several meters to complex smaller-scale surfaces that
follow pre-existing lava carapace cooling joints or wend between
brecciated lava clasts (**Fig. 1f**). *In-situ* fracture surfaces
display prominent, predominantly vertical grooves and impact marks
(**Fig. 1f**), but negligible evidence for shear displacement. Surfaces
are coated by variably sintered, fine-grained ash veneers, ranging from
dense, red indurated layers to dusty pink/yellow coatings that thicken
into surface hollows and appear to be vertically extensive into the
lava. Veneers are several microns to millimetres thick (**Figs 1f,g**)
and contain embedded, angular larger crystalline lava clasts ≤10 cm
across, themselves coated by a veneer of glassy ash.

Scanning electron microscopy of ash veneers reveals vesicle-free, glassy
ash shards and rounded fragments with grain diameters in the range
0.1---100 µm (**Fig. 2a--c**) and predominantly \<1 µm (**Fig 2d**). Ash
morphologies range from angular, with conchoidal fracture surfaces, to
near-spherical and droplet-like with narrow necks between ash particles
and other surfaces (**Fig. 2c**). In some cases, the ash particles are
coalesced into smooth surface coatings (**Figs 1f & 2a**). Clusters of
strongly-sintered clasts \~10 µm across and aligned, millimetric
pellet-like agglomerations that themselves consist of finer-grained ash.
Pellets are aligned parallel to the ropy texture conspicuous on many
surfaces (**Fig. 1f**). A thin outer layer of coarser clasts commonly
adheres to hollows in the strongly-sintered ash veneer, whereas some
veneer-free surfaces instead display scouring. We interpret these
textures as representing varying degrees of sintering^26,27^, which is
most progressed in the finest-grained coating material where there is
near-complete inter-particle porosity destruction^27^ and where smooth
surface coatings result (**Fig. 2**). Larger particles, pellets, and
aggregates are less well sintered with incipient necks representing only
the early stages of sintering^27^. We infer the scouring to represent a
combination of mechanical abrasion and corrosion of glass.

**Capture and sticking of volcanic droplets**

The observation of variably sintered fine-ash veneers coating the
margins of what were active ash-venting pathways can be described in the
context of our current understanding of silicic explosive-effusive
transitions^2,10^. Here, we distil three starting observations that can
be used to underpin a description of the dynamics that form the observed
ash-veneers, and help us to interpret their significance for eruptions.
First, ash must have been generated down to the ultra-fine, sub-micron
particle sizes observed in the sintered veneers (**Fig 2**). Second, the
particles must have been transported in a gas-ash dispersion (observed
in ash-laden jets during the eruption and feeding the intermittent
gas-ash plumes that characterise the hybrid explosive-effusive eruptive
style; **Fig. 1b**). Third, the fine particles must have sintered
rapidly to the fracture walls without rebounding or being re-entrained
into the bypassing flow. From these observations, we posit that the
grainsize of the material in the sintered surface deposits---extremely
fine when compared with fall deposits derived from the same eruptive
phases^28,29^---governed their preferential capture and sintering to the
surface. This in turn requires an exceptional flow and depositional
environment that would have fostered fines being preferentially
transported to the walls and sequestered in the boundary layer flow at
the wall, despite there being proximal and simultaneous high-energy
flows capable of transporting larger particles beyond the walls and into
the erupting plume. We use these conceptual starting points to underpin
a scaling analysis of the transport and deposition regimes involved in
order to gain insight in to the timescales and mechanisms involved.

The first question is whether or not particles in turbulent flow (see
**Methods**) will contact the wall, or be transported through the
fracture without interacting with the wall. The characteristic timescale
of motion of a particle of diameter $d$ in a flow is
![equation](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=%24%5Clambda_%7Bp%7D%20%3D%20%5Crho%20d%5E%7B2%7D%2F%2818%5Cmu_%7Bf%7D%29%24&bc=White&fc=Black&im=jpg&fs=12&ff=arev&edit=0), where $\rho$ is the particle
density and $\mu_{f}$ the dynamic viscosity of the carrier phase. The
response of the particle to flow turbulence is described by the Stokes
number St, which is the ratio of $\lambda_{p}$ to a characteristic fluid
timescale $\lambda_{f}$, in turn a function of a given eddy size and
velocity within the flow. Therefore,
$St = \rho d^{2}/(18\mu_{f}\lambda_{f})$ where $St \gg 1\ $represents
particles that are not well-coupled to the flow and may impact the
walls. The Stokes number also correlates with the organisation of
particles within an eddy, controlling their local concentration or
dispersal as a function of their size^30^.

We can place bounds on the maximum and minimum eddy sizes possible in
turbulent flow as corresponding to either the fracture aperture *L*
(upper bound) or the Kolmogorov lengthscale $\delta_{K}$ (lower bound),
respectively. First, the upper bound on the maximum eddy size is
associated with a maximum fluid timescale
${\lambda_{f} = \lambda}_{O} = L/\left\langle u \right\rangle$, where
$\left\langle u \right\rangle$ is the mean velocity of the flow. Second,
the minimum eddy size is associated with the Kolmogorov timescale
$\lambda_{f} = \lambda_{K} = \sqrt{\nu/\varepsilon}$, where $\nu$ is the
kinematic viscosity of the fluid,
${\varepsilon = \nu}^{3}/\delta_{K}^{4}$ is the average rate of
dissipation of turbulence kinetic energy per unit mass, and
$\delta_{K} = \ \nu/\langle u\rangle$. At high Reynolds number
(**Methods**), turbulence generates eddies from the scale of
$\delta_{K}$ to *L,* meaning that there exists a range of potential St
associated with any given particle size, depending on the eddy size
local to the particle. In $u$-$R$ space (**Fig 3a**), we can delineate
three regimes of particle response to turbulent flow: St $\gg 1$,
wherein particles cross streamlines and may impact walls; St $\ll 1$,
wherein particles follow streamlines; and St \~1, wherein particles will
tend to concentrate (cluster) at the periphery of eddies, potentially
decoupling from the gyratory flowpath^31^ (**Fig 3a**). In detail, the
condition St = 1 may be met depending on the eddy size (between
$\delta_{K}$ and *L*). In **Fig** **3a** we plot these regimes for the
fracture width *L* = 0.01 m measured in the vent at Cordón Caulle;
notably, the St \~1 regime corresponds well with the observed particle
size distribution at velocities of the order of
$\left\langle u \right\rangle$. Experiments and simulations illustrate
that when St $\sim 1$, non-uniform particle distribution is
observed^30,31^. The fact that the observed grainsize distribution falls
within the range whereby St\~1 suggests that this size fraction in
particular is dynamically decoupled from the carrier phase and will
cluster in the flow. Particles that are not large enough to be on truly
ballistic trajectories ($\text{St} \gg 1)$ and not small enough to
follow the smallest eddy flows in an effectively passive manner
($\text{St} \ll 1)$ exhibit a particular tendency to migrate from
regions of high turbulence to low-turbulence-intensity regions^32,33^
via a phenomenon termed turbophoresis.

Turbophoresis serves to segregate particles axially toward the wall
region, and is facilitated by a viscous boundary layer at the wall that
in turn arises from the velocity differential beyween
$\left\langle u \right\rangle$ and $u_{T}$ (the boundary friction
velocity^34^; see **Methods**). Having determined that a portion of the
particles are at $\text{St} > 1\ $and can undergo a particle-wall
interaction, we now determine the dynamics of that interaction by
considering the particles---at magmatic temperatures---to effectively be
viscous droplets. At the droplet scale, isothermal dynamics can be
characterised by the Eötvös, Ohnesorge, and Weber numbers (Eo, Oh, and
We, respectively, see **Methods**).

Taking a representative value of surface tension $\Gamma =$ 0.36
$\text{N\ m}^{- 1\ }$for degassed volcanic particles^35--37^,
characteristic particle radii *R* of order
${1.3 \times 10}^{- 7} \leq R \leq 2.6 \times 10^{- 6}\ $m (**Fig. 2d**)
yield Eo $\ll$ 1, indicating that the effect of body forces arising from
gravity are negligible. In addition, $\text{Oh} \gg \sqrt{\text{We}}$
for temperate-dependent droplet viscosity $\mu$(*T*) of 1.56
$\times 10^{8}$ Pa s \[refs. ^38,39^\], where *T* = 900 °C. Taking
$\langle u\rangle = \ 100\ \text{m\ }s^{- 1}$ to be the characteristic
exit velocity of particles based on image velocimetry^9^ and
$u_{\theta}$ to be the impact angle--scaled velocity (**Methods**), We
is typically \> 1. In **Fig. 3b** we plot upper and lower bounds on the
Oh-We plane^40^. The majority of feasible values plot in regime IV, in
which the force driving the impact droplet-wall interaction is the
impact force itself, capillary forces at the contact line of the droplet
are negligible, and the force resisting the impact interaction arises
from the viscosity of the droplet. Consequently, we can establish the
characteristic timescale of the droplet-wall interaction as
$\lambda_{d} = \mu\left( \rho u_{\theta}^{2} \right)^{- 1}$, where
$\rho$ is droplet density.

Finally, we address whether or not a particle can sinter on the
timescale available in the interaction. To assess this, we appeal to the
observation that in all droplet-wall interactions reproduced
experimentally, interaction will result in sticking if the droplet is
viscous at the time of impact^40,41^. As more droplets interact and
stick, the sintering process that creates a less porous and stronger
deposit layer (i.e. the "porosity destruction" inferred above) is
governed by the timescale for particle viscous sintering---driven by
surface tension at the interface of the particles---and is
$\lambda_{\Gamma} = R\mu/\Gamma$, yielding timescales \~55--1104 s.
These values are similar to the interaction times
${7 \leq \lambda}_{d} \leq 647\ $s for ${100 \geq u}_{\theta} \geq 10$ m
s^-1^, and are also generally within the timescale of ash-jetting
episodes (seconds to tens of seconds^9^). We note that any nonzero
pressure differential acting on the droplets in excess of the gas
pressure will serve to accelerate the sintering process^2,26,27^. Recent
work has shown that small rhyolitic ash particles (*R*\~10^-6^ m and
smaller) will sinter more readily than larger particles, despite a
smaller size fraction being more thoroughly degassed at the Earth's
surface and therefore having a higher viscosity^2^.

Particle organisation and entrapment could be enhanced by electrostatic
forces^42,43^, particle-dispersion heating by any particle-particle and
particle-wall friction at high particle volume fractions, the growth of
viscous boundary layers during waning flow, and large wall asperities
that host low velocity eddies. Taken together, this analysis
demonstrates (1) the turbulent motion of the carrier phase should
migrate fines towards the fracture/conduit walls, in particular (2)
those particles within the $10^{- 7} \leq R \leq 10^{- 5}$ m range are
most likely to decouple from the carrier phase and subsequently impact
the walls and interact, and (3) that interacting particles can stick and
sinter. Critically, our analysis highlights that the small grainsize is
the key parameter at each step of preferential segregation, transport,
and sticking.

**Grain size fractionation**

In this work, we show that fine volcanic ash particles have stuck to
fracture planes during ash venting, and were therefore captured and
sintered while capable of viscous deformation. It is small particles at
the low end of the high-Stokes-number regime that will be preferentially
transported by turbophoresis and therefore sintered to the walls; as
such, fine particles are fractionated from the TGSD prior to eruption
into the plume. TGSD is used as a window into pre- and syn-eruptive
fragmentation^44^, and to directly infer sub-surface magmatic
processes^28^. Conventionally, reconstructed TGSDs inform---albeit
indirectly---the mechanisms, efficiency, and depth of magma
fragmentation and the total explosive energy release^45--47^. Moreover,
TGSDs are used to determine initial tephra size distributions, a
critical source term for ash dispersal models^28,48^. Fundamentally,
such estimates rely on the basic assumption that reconstructed TGSDs are
directly related to these source parameters; however, secondary
processes may modify the size distribution of primary fragmentation
products^13^. The TGSD from the Córdon Caulle 2011 eruption has been
reconstructed or otherwise estimated by various methods^16,28,29^. These
estimates differ, both in terms of range and modality (**Fig. 4a**);
importantly however, there is little overlap with the size distribution
associated with the features of this study. The fine ash fraction
observed here therefore reflects more energetic fragmentation^45^ than
the relatively larger fraction captured by post-emplacement
approximations (**Fig. 4c**), which cannot fully capture the energetics
or mechanics of fragmentation at depth both due to fine-ash entrapment
within the conduit, and to syn- and post-eruption processes including
aggregation, winnowing, and remobilisation^49^.

The capture and sintering of particles in the volcanic sub-surface has
recently been suggested as a mechanism to assemble silicic lava
bodies^2,10^ as a whole. A tantalising implication of this model is that
the process of within-conduit sticking and sintering is volumetrically
significant relative to the whole erupted volume, and may mean that the
fines production at depth (1) is volumetrically substantial, and (2)
represents a significant proportion of the explosive energy^45^. The
downstream implication is that the fragmentation energy may be higher
than can be predicted by observations of grain sizes in fall
deposits---reinforced by recent recognition that many silicic pumice
clasts are in fact sintered agglomerates^13^. Other
processes---including shear or abrasion mechanisms^50,51^ and related
in-conduit comminution processes^52^---act to divorce grain size
distributions from the magmatic source conditions, increasing the fines
proportion relative to the size distribution produced at true magmatic
fragmentation at depth. By contrast, the process we invoke to explain
our observations acts in the opposite direction, sequestering fine
grains and leaving a relatively coarser grain size distribution to erupt
in the plume than that produced at magmatic fragmentation (**Fig. 4c**).
In concert, these effects both may strongly decouple the erupted
pyroclast and ash size distribution from the magmatic source conditions.

**Implications for silicic eruption dynamics**

The Cordón Caulle eruption allowed the observation of contemporaneous
explosive and effusive behaviour, a phenomenon which has since been
interpreted as a product of continued in-conduit explosive
fragmentation^15^ and variable reaggregation of clasts via sintering^2^.
Our data further support this hypothesis. The measured size distribution
is indicative of highly efficient fragmentation^46,53^ and means that
these ashy veneers record fragmentation processes at Cordón Caulle that
are not captured through existing TGSD reconstructions (**Fig. 4a**). It
is likely that energetic magmatic fragmentation was sustained throughout
the hybrid phases of the Cordón Caulle eruption^2^, with in-conduit
organisation and sintering effectively removing the evidence of this
process from the erupted componentry. This is supported by evidence of
ash-coated fracture planes distal to the main vent (**Fig. 5a**). In
order to fully capture the dynamics of hybrid silicic
volcanism---critical to hazard mitigation---models of eruptive activity
must couple the influence of continuous, energetic fragmentation and the
preferential in-conduit entrapment of ultrafine ash.

There is mounting evidence that silicic eruptions are characterised by
explosive fragmentation and variable in-conduit re-aggregation of
magma^2,3,11,13^; the fact that the vent "nozzles" examined here
preserve evidence of essentially the same processes suggests that these
mechanisms may be self-similar across spatial scales. We show that
particle capture and sticking are functions of conduit or fracture
width, which may itself evolve as the walls are progressively coated
with a sequestered ash fraction. A key implication of this model is that
the transport of ash from its fragmentation source to the vent not only
modifies the subsequent recorded componentry, but may in fact directly
influence eruptive dynamics by altering variables such as conduit width,
particle density, and bulk viscosity. In addition, our model predicts
that gradual waning of vent flux (i.e. a decrease in
$\left\langle u \right\rangle$: **Fig. 3a**) may facilitate the capture
of a progressively larger size fraction---as observed elsewhere in the
flowfield (**Fig. 4a**)---potentially to the point of occluding the
fracture entirely. We have focussed here on ash-coated nozzle structures
at the main vent of Cordón Caulle; we note, however, that not only do
comparable features exist throughout the flowfield (**Fig. 4a**), but
also at other rhyolitic volcanoes: **Figure 4b** shows evidence exists
of similarly veneered fracture surfaces at Medicine Lake volcano (USA).
This fact suggests that the processes described are ubiquitous
throughout rhyolitic systems and occur throughout hybrid activity---even
in the earliest stages . Considering post-fragmentation processes in
terms of a hot, particle-laden (i.e. dusty) gas flow thus represents a
frontier in silicic eruption modelling.

**Methods**

**Plume height**

Measurements of plume height were collected by El Servicio Nacional de
Geología y Minería (SERNAGEOMIN) and Observatorio Volcanológico de los
Andes del Sur (OVDAS)^25^.

**Videography**

Activity was recorded in January 2012 using a Canon XF105 video camera
at 25 FPS in visible light mode. For further details, the reader is
referred to ref. ^9^.

**Microscopy and grainsize analysis**

Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images were collected at the
University of Liverpool, with a Philips XL30 tungsten filament SEM used
on carbon-coated standard petrographic thin sections. The grain sizes
discussed here are generally too small for many conventional analyses.
In order to determine a grain size distribution, the grain diameters
from a representative SEM image were manually measured with ImageJ, and
diameters converted to a mass distribution by assuming a spherical
particle geometry, with melt density as defined previously.

**Dimensionless number calculation**

Flow turbulence in a wall-bounded particle-laden gas flow is
characterised by the Reynolds number Re
$= \left\langle u \right\rangle L/\nu$, where
$\left\langle u \right\rangle$ is the mean velocity of the flow, *L* a
characteristic lengthscale (in this case the fracture width), and $\nu$
the kinematic viscosity of the fluid. In flow through a slot geometry,
fully developed turbulence is expected when $\text{Re} \geq \ 2900$
\[ref.^34^\]. Given estimates of $\left\langle u \right\rangle$
$\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}100 m.s^-1^ \[ref. 9\], $0.01 < L < 1$ m \[refs.
^4,9,54,55^\], and $\nu(T) = \ $`<!-- -->`{=html}1.4 × 10^-4^ m^2^s^-1^,
gas venting through fractures during the Cordón-Caulle eruption can be
assumed to be highly turbulent
($7.14 \times 10^{3} \lesssim Re \lesssim 7.14 \times 10^{5}$).

At the droplet scale, isothermal dynamics can be characterised by the
Eötvös (Eo), Ohnesorge (Oh), and Weber (We) numbers. Eo defines the
ratio of gravitational and surface tension forces: Eo =
$\text{ρg}R^{2}/\Gamma$, where $\rho$ is droplet density, $g$ is
gravitational acceleration, $R$ is the particle radius (*d*/2), and
$\Gamma$ is interfacial tension at the wall. Oh characterises the
relative importance of viscous and inertial forces arising from
capillary flow: Oh = $\mu/\sqrt{\rho\Gamma R}$, where $\mu$ is droplet
viscosity. Weber number We scales the effects of inertia and surface
tension forces: We = $\text{ρR}u_{\theta}^{2}/\Gamma$, where
$u_{\theta}$ is the relative droplet velocity, here scaled by the impact
angle $\theta$ such that $u_{\theta} = \cos\theta\langle u\rangle$. Note
that for a uniform distribution of potential impact angles
$0 < \theta < \pi$, 50 % of $u_{\theta}$ will be 87 m s^-1^ or greater:
only at very high 'glancing' impact angles does $u_{\theta}$ approach
zero. We $\gg \ $`<!-- -->`{=html}1 and We $\ll \ $`<!-- -->`{=html}1
denote the inertial and capillary fields respectively; for Oh, the
critical value is given by $\sqrt{\text{We}}$ such that
$\text{Oh} \gg \sqrt{\text{We}}$ and $Oh \ll \ \sqrt{\text{We}}$ denote
the viscous and inertial fields, respectively^40^.

**Boundary layer thickness calculation**

In the region of fluid adjacent to the wall, there is a sub-layer in
which the velocity of the bypassing fluid drops to lower values compared
with the centre-line velocity. In order to assess the extent to which
this sub-layer is laminar and represents a viscous boundary layer of
appreciable thickness, we scale the dimensionless normal distance from
the wall as  $\overline{y} = yu_{T}/\nu$, where $y$ is the dimensional
wall-normal direction, and $u_{T}$ is the boundary friction
velocity^34^. To a first-order approximation, the viscous sub-layer
occurs at $\overline{y} < 10$, a region in which the velocity profile is
approximately linear $u(y) = \overline{y}u_{T}\ $(ref: ^34^). This
scaling implicates $u_{T}$ as the key unknown, and while the standard
scaling is $u_{T} = \sqrt{\tau_{w}/\rho_{f}},$ where $\rho_{f}$ is the
fluid density, this still leaves $\tau_{w}$ as an unknown^34^. Instead,
we use the approximation
$u_{T} \approx 0.05\left\langle u \right\rangle$ for fully developed
turbulence, which implies that the thickness of the region at
$\overline{y} < 10$ is at $y_{v} = 200\nu/\left\langle u \right\rangle$.
Given the bounds on $\left\langle u \right\rangle$ and $\nu$ used
earlier, this results in a minimum viscous boundary layer of thickness
$y_{v} \approx 2.8 \times 10^{- 4}\ m$. This is larger than both the
surface roughness lengthscale, and the particle sizes observed at the
surface (**Fig. 2b**), implying that the flow in this region will be
hydraulically smooth. We note that this simple scaling implies that
$y_{v} \propto \left\langle u \right\rangle^{- 1}$, for which waning
flow velocities would result in thicker boundary layers and more
opportunity for particle entrainment and capture.

**Figure 4 A grain size fractionation model for Cordón Caulle volcano.
a** Data in this study reflect a captured in-conduit fine ash fraction,
characterised by a mean diameter *d* of 9.12 $\times 10^{- 7}$ m.
Distribution assumed by Reckziegel et al. \[ref. 29\] are approximately
unimodal and described by mean of *d* = 3.10 $\times 10^{- 4}$ m. Data
of Costa et al. \[ref. 28\], reconstructed from field data, are bimodal,
described by lognormal peaks at *d* = 1.34 $\times 10^{- 5}$ and *d* =
5.39 $\times 10^{- 3}$ m. Mean and $\pm 2\sigma$ range are highlighted
for data of this study and ref. 29; these values are shown for each of
the peaks of ref. 28. **b** In-conduit processes summarised
schematically. Magmatic particles are transported in a gas phase at a
mean velocity of $\langle u\rangle$. Flow turbulence results in
clustering and decoupling of particles (1) of St $\geq 1$ from the eddy
motion, in addition to turbophoresis (2) which results in elevated
concentration of particles at the wall. Particles may then impact the
wall (3) at velocity $u_{\theta}$---dependent on $\theta$---then sinter
rapidly (4). **c** Energetic fragmentation within the conduit generates
a population of both fine and coarse particles; due to the processes
outlined in **b**, the relatively fine fraction is preferentially
captured at the walls of ash vents; the emitted ash therefore
predominantly reflects the coarser fraction of the original population.
